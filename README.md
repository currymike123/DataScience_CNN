Cars_196_Dataset.ipynb is the main notebook to run all code from. This notebook is designed to run on AWS Sagemaker with distributed training using Horovood. If you are running it locally comment out all Sagemaker and Horovood code.

Car_Truck is my first notebook for the reduced Car or Truck Dataset.

Crop_Images.py is a script to crop images to the bounding boxes.
